Despite an 1865 report declaring it was \"perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot,\" George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, and in the process created the predecessor for today's cable route.\u003Cp\u003EToday, thousands of people reach the summit. For most, it is an exciting, arduous hike; for a few, it becomes more adventure than they bargained for. Every summer park rangers must assist hundreds of people on the Half Dome trail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most famous--or infamous--part of the hike is the ascent up the cables. The two metal cables allow hikers to climb the last 400 feet to the summit without rock climbing equipment. Since 1919, relatively few people have fallen and died on the cables. However, injuries are not uncommon for those acting irresponsibly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 14 to 16-mile round-trip hike to Half Dome is not for the out of shape or unprepared visitor. Hikers gain an elevation of 4,800 feet on their way to the top of Half Dome, but the reward is worth the effort. Along the way, you'll encounter outstanding views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and - from the subdome and summit - panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes most people 10 to 12 hours to hike to Half Dome and back. If you plan on hiking during the day, it's smart to leave before or at sunrise, with a non-negotiable turn-around time. Check sunrise and sunset times before you embark on your hike, and always bring a flashlight or headlamp with good batteries. Although the trail is well marked, you should be prepared with a good topographic map and compass, with the ability to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch of the hike to Half Dome is an unpredictable adventure into Wilderness, but preparation is paramount. Use the links in the Know Before You Go section and Information from associated websites (on the right-hand-side of the page), for tips to help reduce your risk of injury.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Half Dome Cables are put up each spring and taken down each fall. Traditionally, the first day the cables are up is the Friday before Memorial Day, and the last day the cables are up is the Tuesday after Columbus Day. Environment conditions dictate the actual date the cables are put up, maintained, and taken down for the season.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA permit is required to ascend the subdome steps and Half Dome Cables. Permits are distributed through two lottery processes. A preseason lottery held during the month of March allows hikers the opportunity to plan their trip well in advance. Results of the preseason lottery are announced mid-April. Approximately 225 permits are available each day through the preseason lottery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaily lotteries are held throughout the Half Dome hiking season. These lotteries are run two days prior to any day that the cables are up. The results of the lottery are announced the following day. The application period for each daily lottery is from midnight to 1 pm Pacific time. Approximately 50 permits will be available each day. The actual number of permits available during a daily lottery varies due to the preseason lottery results and cancellations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA person may apply as a trip leader only once per lottery. People applying multiple times as trip leader will have all their lottery applications cancelled. For the preseason lottery, each application allows for up to seven date choices. The maximum group size for a permit application is 6. The person applying is the designated trip leader, and they may identify a single alternate trip leader. For a group to pass beyond the Subdome Check Point, the trip leader or alternate trip leader must be present with government issued photo identification and a copy of the permit. \u003C/p\u003E",

The opening date varies depending on the opening of the Tioga Road and related seasonal facility and road work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPorcupine Flat Campground is located off the Tioga Road about 30 minutes west of Tuolumne Meadows and over an hour from Yosemite Valley. RVs and Trailers are not recommended for the narrow roads in this more primitive campground. At an elevation of 8,100 feet (2,500 m) elevation, the campground is near Porcupine Creek, which is the only water source (must be filtered, treated, or boiled). The Porcupine Creek Trailhead is nearby. There are no visitor services close to the campground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor additional park information, call (209)372-0200 or visit www.nps.gov/yose \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ERecreation\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYosemite's trails, cliffs, roads and rivers provide endless recreational activities for any kind of visitor. Hiking, biking, rock climbing, fishing, horseback riding, rafting, auto touring, and photography are all very popular activities within the park. The White Wolf area has hiking and backpacking opportunities that begin near the campground, such as Lukens Lake, Harden Lake and the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. The Crane Flat area, 23 miles west, offers many other hiking opportunities such as Tuolumne and Merced Groves of Giant Sequoias, both of which require a 2.5 to 3-mile roundtrip hike to view. Tuolumne Meadows and all it's High Sierra wonder lie 25 miles to the east, where many beautiful day and overnight excursions await.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tioga Road offers a 39-mile scenic drive past forests, meadows, lakes, and granite domes. The road’s elevation ranges from 6,200 feet to just under 10,000 feet. Tuolumne Meadows embodies the high-country of the Sierra Nevada and is a good starting point for countless hikes.

Yosemite Valley also offers numerous guided bus tours, educational programs, museums, ranger-led activities, and an art center with workshops.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tioga Road offers a 39-mile scenic drive past forests, meadows, lakes and granite domes.
